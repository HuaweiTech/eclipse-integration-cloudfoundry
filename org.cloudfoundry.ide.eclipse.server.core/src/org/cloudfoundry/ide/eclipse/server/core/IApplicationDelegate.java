	 * archive generates an input stream for each IModuleResource.
	 * 
	 * <p/>
	 * In addition, the application archive is also used to calculate sha1 hash
	 * codes for each application file so that the Cloud Foundry server can
	 * determine what resources have changed prior to the Cloud Foundry
	 * framework pushing any changes to the application.
	 * <p/>
	 * For Java Web type applications (Spring, Grails, Java Web), it is not

	 * Foundry plugin framework generates .war files for such applications and
	 * uses a built-in default application archive that reads the .war file.
	 * <p/>

	 * standalone, .war files are not generated, and therefore serialisation of
	 * the application files is performed through an application archive
	 * specific to Java standalone applications

	 * The default implementation provides a general way to generated an
	 * application archive from IModuleResources for a given IModule. Subclasses
	 * can override this and provide their own archive which converts
	 * IModuleResource into archive entries.
